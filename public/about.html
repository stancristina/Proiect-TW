                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handmade in Portugal, Luxury Gold Jewellery portrays nature and its elements as
                they go through season’s changes. The shapes, the textures and the colours,
                in a continuous cycle of transformation and renovation. The author, Andreia Lima, has had a close
                connection to nature since childhood.
                She used to play with leaves and bugs, creating an imaginary world that now comes to life in the form of
                jewellery.
                Delicate, feminine and full of charming details, Sopro Jewellery collections are very versatile,
                offering different versions and combinations.
                Every piece is carefully designed and executed to perfection to guarantee its uniqueness.
                The collections follow nature’s paths. “Spring” portrays fresh colours and shapes, mainly leaves that
                appear to be softly blown by the season’s breeze.
                “Love me Love me Not” evokes the purest feelings inspired by the spring blossoms. In “Myosotis”, the
                flowers gain structure representing deeper feelings
                as loyalty and true love. “Sea” collection dives into summer colours and shapes, with lively pieces
                perfect for the warm season. “Corium” is inspired by the shape,
                texture and movement of the serpent, a mythological symbol of rejuvenation and eternity. “Stars”
                collection embodies the infinite light of constellations
                in a summer night sky.
                Sopro Jewellery is now releasing two new collections, inspired by autumn bucolic spirit: “Fall” and
                “Forest”. As the leaves slowly turn into warm and
                nostalgic colours, flowers close in, embracing themselves until it's time to fall down. This melancholic
                shape inspired “Fall” collection, that presents
                elegant and contemporary pieces, with detailed textures and peculiar gemstones. “Forest” is a throwback
                to Andreia’s childhood, when she used to collect
                every element she found in the forest, from berries to bugs, from leaves to short wood trunks. The
                collection has simple but meaningful details that connect
                all the pieces in a perfect ecosystem.
