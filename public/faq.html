                    <span>
                        Please read the instruction manual and all the documentation received with your purchase
                        carefully,
                        as it will contain important information regarding the use and care of your Luxury Gold product.
                        Some important tips are:

                        - Avoid placing your watch near any object that gives off a magnetic field, such as TVs,
                        speakers, even the magnet of a handbag, as this may have an effect on the precision of your
                        watch.
                        - Always rinse your watch with clear water after being exposed to salt water.
                        - Do not manipulate the crown of your watch under water.
                        - Avoid extreme temperatures and sudden temperature changes.
                        - Avoid contact with acidic substances, perfumes or make-up products.

                        Additionally, please consult the TIPS ON CARING FOR YOUR PRODUCT section for additional advice.

                        WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MECHANICAL HAND-WOUND MOVEMENT, AN AUTOMATIC SELF-WINDING
                        MOVEMENT, AND A QUARTZ MOVEMENT?
                    </p>

                    <span>
                        A watch with a mechanical hand-wound movement must always be wound manually by its wearer.
                        Winding is done by turning the crown clockwise, and is complete when the crown locks. Do not
                        attempt to wind a watch past this locking point, since this might damage the movement. We
                        recommend that you manually wind the watch at the same time each day.

                        A watch with an automatic self-winding movement has a mechanism that winds the mainspring
                        through the motion of your wrist. The motion of your wrist makes a rotor turn, which winds the
                        mainspring. When the mainspring is fully wound, it has a minimum power reserve of 40 hours and a
                        maximum of 9 days depending on the model. A watch with an automatic self-winding movement is
                        equipped with a sliding mainspring which is a mechanism placed in the barrel to avoid
                        over-winding of the mainspring. If the watch has stopped, wind it manually before wearing it by
                        making around 50 clockwise turns of the crown.

                        Be aware that some models have a screwed crown. Before making adjustments, unscrew the crown
                        counterclockwise wise.

                        A quartz watch is powered by a battery. It offers the advantage of no particular action if the
                        watch is not worn daily. If the watch has stopped, the battery needs to be replaced. If you do
                        not wear your watch every day, we recommend that you pull out the crown to stop the watch in
                        order to prolong the life of your battery.

                        HOW DOES THE PRECISION OF A MECHANICAL WATCH COMPARE TO THAT OF A QUARTZ WATCH?
                    </p>
                    <span>
                        A quartz movement will always be more precise, as it utilizes an electric micro-processor to
                        keep time. A mechanical watch offers a degree of precision implying a variation of around 1
                        minute per week, 5 minutes per month, 1 hour per year. A quartz movement varies by 1 second per
                        week, 5 seconds per month, 1 minute per year. The comparison of these figures shows that an
                        electronic movement offers a degree of precision 60 times superior to that of a mechanical
                        movement. Electronics enable almost absolute precision.

                        WHAT DETERMINES THE PRECISION OF A MECHANICAL WATCH?

                    <span>
                        The precision of a mechanical watch depends on a number of parameters: the quality of the
                        components used to assemble the movement; the accuracy of the alignment of the balance wheel and
                        the knowledge and qualifications of the watch technicians assembling the watch.

                        WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHRONOGRAPH AND A CHRONOMETER?
                    </p>
                    <span>
                        A chronograph is a watch with hands that display hours, minutes and seconds, together with a
                        mechanism for measuring elapsed time by means of a central chronograph hand, which records
                        seconds and tantalizers for the minutes and hours (not mandatory). A chronometer is a watch
                        whose movement has obtained an official rate certificate from the COSC (Official Swiss
                        Chronometer Testing Institute) after having passed precision tests in different positions and at
                        different temperatures. These tests are conducted over a 15-day period.

                        Adjustment is the set of operations performed by the watchmaker on the regulating organ (balance
                        & air spring) that ensures the smooth running and accuracy of the watch.

                    <span>
                        The Swiss Official Chronometer Testing Institute (COSC) certifies the precision of the
                        movements. During 16 days of tests, the precision of mechanical movements is measured in five
                        positions and at three different temperatures. Whatever these conditions, the movements must
                        maintain a precision ranging between -4 and +6 seconds per day for calibres measuring less than
                        20 mm in diameter, and between -5 and +8 seconds for smaller calibres. Movements meeting the
                        precision criteria are granted a chronometer certificate – a privilege reserved for only 3% of
                        total watch production in Switzerland.

                        WHAT IS THE POINCON DE GENEVE (HALLMARK OF GENEVA) CERTIFICATION?
                    </p>
                    <span>
                        The “Poincon de Geneve” quality hallmark, created in 1886 in order to protect Genevan
                        watchmaking, involves three fundamental conditions of admission and different qualifying
                        criteria. A watch is thus only eligible if its movement is assembled and adjusted in Canton
                        Geneva, if it is numbered and if it meets the craftsmanship criteria established by the
                        Technical Committee. These criteria involve the finishing of the parts (chamfered and hand-drawn
                        bridges, polished sinks, chamfered going train) and their characteristics (type of balance
                        wheel-spring pinning, type of index, thickness of the escape wheel), as well as the non-use of
                        certain parts such as wire springs. Techniques and materials evolve and, for its 125th
                        anniversary, the “Poincon de Geneve” decided to keep up with this evolution by adapting its
                        demands. Formally amended in November 2011, the new hallmark regulations came into force in June
                        2012. From this date onwards, its certification will encompass the watch as a whole. The
                        “Poincon de Geneve” quality hallmark is an all-in-one guarantee of origin, craftsmanship and
                        durability.

                    <span>
                        The Fleurier Quality Foundation is another independent body to which Chopard Manufacture resorts
                        to in order to test the quality of its timepieces. In addition to submitting the movements to
                        the Swiss Official Chronometer Testing Institute (COSC) in order to guarantee precision, the
                        timepieces are tested as a whole in order to appraise their overall quality. The Chronofiable
                        test verifies the durability of its movement by subjecting it to an ageing cycle, a cycle
                        measuring pull-push forces on the winding stem, as well as tests of resistance to magnetic
                        fields; and, finally, a shock-resistance test using a dedicated striker. The watch must also
                        comply with the numerous specific technical and aesthetic criteria contained in the technical
                        regulations of the Fleurier Quality Foundation (involving the choice of materials, of decorative
                        techniques, and of finishes). Finally, the rate of the finished watch must be tested on the
                        Fleuritest machine, which replicates the conditions implied by 24 hours of wear in the most
                        realistic possible way, and verifies that the variation in rate falls within 0 and +5 seconds
                        per day.
